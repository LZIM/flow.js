For all attribute matchers, give it an operation to continue propagation or just stop

<table>
    <tr f-value="Price"> f-with?
        <td f-value="[1]">

        </td>
        <td f-value="[2]">

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


Should be able to call with text - then should just populate and not bind (?)

Priorities for generators

Give all binders an object, and use an object.observer shim?

Currently bind is the only 2 way attribute. Also make 'value', 'checked' two way
